## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/psyray/oasis.git
cd oasis
```

2. Install with pipx:
```bash
# First time installation
pipx install --editable .
```

## 🔄 Update

If new releases are available, you can update the installation with:
```bash
git pull origin master
pipx upgrade oasis
```
**NOTE**: because of the editable installation, you just need to pull the latest changes from the repository to update your global **oasis** command installed with pipx.
So the pipx upgrade is not mandatory, only if needed to bump version in pipx

Or test a feature branch before official release (could be unstable)
```
git fetch --all
git checkout feat/vX.X
```

## 🗑️ Uninstallation
```bash
pipx uninstall oasis
```

## 🔧 Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
oasis --input [path_to_analyze]
```

## 🚀 Quick Test

To quickly test OASIS with sample files:
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/psyray/oasis.git
cd oasis
pipx install --editable .

# Run analysis on test files
oasis --input test_files/
```

This will analyze the provided test files and generate security reports in the parent directory of the folder to analyze, `security_reports`.

## 🔥 Advanced Usage Examples

Standard two-phase analysis with separate models:
```bash
# Use a lightweight model for initial scanning and a powerful model for deep analysis
oasis -i [path_to_analyze] -sm gemma3:4b -m gemma3:27b
```

Adaptive multi-level analysis:
```bash
# Use adaptive analysis mode with custom threshold

## 💡 Getting the Most out of OASIS

### Model Selection Strategy

OASIS uses a two-phase scanning approach that leverages different models for optimal results:

#### Model Selection by Purpose
- **Initial Scanning Models** (4-7B parameters):
  - Optimized for speed: `gemma3:4b`, `llama3.2:3b`, `phi3:mini`
  - Used for quick pattern matching and identifying potentially suspicious code segments
  - Resource-efficient for scanning large codebases

- **Deep Analysis Models** (>20B parameters):
  - Optimized for thorough analysis: `gemma3:27b`, `deepseek-r1:32b`, `qwen2.5-coder:32b`, `mistral-nemo`, `mixtral:instruct`
  - Used only for code sections flagged as suspicious in the initial scan
  - Provides detailed vulnerability assessment

- **Specialized Code Models**:
  - Code-specific models: `codellama`, `codestral`, `starcoder`, `phind-codellama`
  - Best for specific languages and frameworks
  - `codellama` for general code, `codestral` for Python/C++, `starcoder/phind-codellama` for web technologies

#### Example Model Combinations

```bash
# For quick analysis of a small project
oasis -i ./src -sm llama3.2:3b -m llama3.2:8b

# For thorough analysis of web application code (PHP, JavaScript)
oasis -i ./webapp -sm gemma3:4b -m codellama:34b -v xss,sqli,csrf

# For security audit of Python backend with specialized models
oasis -i ./backend -sm phi3:mini -m deepseek-r1:32b,qwen2.5-coder:32b -v rce,input,data

# For critical infrastructure security analysis (most thorough)
oasis -i ./critical-service -sm gemma3:7b -m mixtral:instruct -v all --adaptive -t 0.6
```

### Scanning Workflows: Standard vs Adaptive

OASIS offers two different analysis approaches, each with distinct advantages:

#### Standard Two-Phase Workflow

This workflow uses a sequential approach with two distinct phases:

1. **Initial Scanning Phase**:
   - Uses a lightweight model specified by `-sm`
   - Scans entire codebase to identify potentially suspicious chunks
   - Creates a map of suspicious sections for deep analysis

2. **Deep Analysis Phase**:
   - Uses more powerful model(s) specified by `-m`
   - Analyzes only chunks flagged as suspicious in phase 1
   - Generates comprehensive analysis reports

**Best for**: Large codebases with uniform risk profiles, predictable resource planning

#### Adaptive Multi-Level Workflow

The adaptive workflow employs a dynamic approach that adjusts analysis depth based on risk assessment:

1. **Level 1**: Static pattern-based analysis (fastest)
2. **Level 2**: Lightweight model scan for initial screening
3. **Level 3**: Medium-depth context analysis with risk scoring
4. **Level 4**: Deep analysis only for high-risk chunks

**Best for**: Critical systems with varied risk profiles, complex codebases requiring nuanced analysis

#### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Standard Two-Phase | Adaptive Multi-Level |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Speed** | Faster for average cases | Faster for low-risk code, slower overall |
| **Resource Usage** | Predictable, efficient | Variable, optimized for risk |
| **Detection Accuracy** | Good for obvious vulnerabilities | Better for subtle, context-dependent issues |
| **False Positives** | More common | Reduced through context analysis |
| **Resource Allocation** | Fixed per phase | Dynamically adjusted by risk |
| **Command Flag** | Default | Use `--adaptive` `-ad` |

### Optimization Tips

For the best results with OASIS:

1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Leverage the dual-layer caching system for repeated scans
   - Only clear embedding cache (`-cce`) when changing embedding models or after major code changes
   - Clear scan cache (`-ccs`) when upgrading to better models or after fixing vulnerabilities

2. **Workflow Optimization**:
   - Start with higher thresholds (0.7-0.8) for large codebases to focus on high-probability issues
   - Use `--audit` mode to understand vulnerability distribution before full analysis
   - Specify relevant vulnerability types (`-v`) and file extensions (`-x`) to target your analysis

3. **Resource Management**:
   - For large projects, run initial scans during off-hours
   - Balance CPU/GPU usage by choosing appropriate model sizes
   - Use model combinations that maximize speed and accuracy based on your hardware

4. **Report Utilization**:
   - View HTML reports for the best interactive experience
   - Use the web interface (`--web`) for team collaboration
   - Export PDF reports for documentation and sharing

## 💾 Cache Management

OASIS implements a sophisticated dual-layer caching system to optimize performance:

### Embedding Cache
- Stores vector embeddings of your codebase to avoid recomputing them for repeated analyses
- Default cache duration: 7 days
- Cache location: `.oasis_cache/[embedding_model_name]/`
- Use `--clear-cache-embeddings` (`-cce`) to force regeneration of embeddings

### Analysis Cache
- Stores the results of LLM-based vulnerability scanning for each model and analysis mode
- Separate caches for scan (lightweight) and deep analysis results
- Model-specific caching ensures results are tied to the specific model used
- Analysis type-aware (standard vs. adaptive)
- Use `--clear-cache-scan` (`-ccs`) to force fresh vulnerability scanning

This dual-layer approach dramatically improves performance:
- First-time analysis: Compute embeddings + full scanning
- Repeated analysis (same code): Reuse embeddings + scanning results
- After code changes: Update only changed file embeddings + scan only modified components

The cache system intelligently handles:
- Different model combinations (scan model + deep model)
- Different analysis types and modes
- Different vulnerability types
- Cache expiration based on configured days

For the best performance:
- Only clear the embedding cache when changing embedding models or after major code changes
- Clear the scan cache when upgrading to a newer/better model or after fixing vulnerabilities

## 📊 Audit Mode

OASIS offers a specialized Audit Mode that performs an embedding distribution analysis to help you understand your codebase's vulnerability profile before conducting a full scan.

```bash
# Run OASIS in audit mode
oasis --input [path_to_analyze] --audit
```

### What Audit Mode Does

- **Embedding Analysis**: Generates embeddings for your entire codebase and all vulnerability types
- **Similarity Distribution**: Calculates similarity scores between your code and various vulnerability patterns
- **Threshold Analysis**: Shows the distribution of similarity scores across different thresholds
- **Statistical Overview**: Provides mean, median, and max similarity scores for each vulnerability type
- **Top Matches**: Identifies the files or functions with the highest similarity to each vulnerability type

### Benefits of Audit Mode

- **Pre-Scan Intelligence**: Understand which vulnerability types are most likely to be present in your codebase
- **Threshold Optimization**: Determine the optimal similarity threshold for your specific project
- **Resource Planning**: Identify which vulnerabilities require deeper analysis with more powerful models
- **Faster Insights**: Get a quick overview without running a full security analysis
- **Targeted Scanning**: Use the results to focus your main analysis on the most relevant vulnerability types

### Example Workflow

1. **Initial Audit**: 
   ```bash
   oasis -i [path_to_analyze] --audit
   ```

2. **Targeted Analysis** based on audit results:
   ```bash
   oasis -i [path_to_analyze] -v sqli,xss,rce -t 0.65
   ```

The Audit Mode is especially valuable for large codebases where a full scan might be time-consuming, allowing you to make informed decisions about where to focus your security analysis efforts.

## 🌐 Web Interface

OASIS includes a web interface to view and explore security reports:

<img src=".github/images/webserver.png" alt="OASIS Logo" width="100%"/>

<br>

```bash
# Start the web interface with default settings (localhost:5000)
oasis --input [path_to_analyze] --web

# Start with custom port and expose to all network interfaces
oasis --input [path_to_analyze] --web --web-port 8080 --web-expose all

# Start with a specific password
oasis --input [path_to_analyze] --web --web-password mysecretpassword
```

### Security Features

- **Password Protection**: By default, a random password is generated and displayed in the console
- **Network Isolation**: By default, the server only listens on 127.0.0.1
- **Custom Port**: Configurable port to avoid conflicts with other services

When no password is specified, a secure random password will be generated and displayed in the console output. The web interface provides a dashboard to explore security reports, filter results, and view detailed vulnerability information.
